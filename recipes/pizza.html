    <p>Perfect Italian pizza</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>250 ml warm water</li>
        <li>1 cube of yeast</li>
        <li>1 pinch of sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons oil</li>
        <li>500g flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour 250ml warm water into a measuring cup. Crumble in the yeast and mix with a pinch of sugar and salt. Let rise for 10-15 minutes.</li>
        
        <li>Place the flour and salt in a bowl. Pour liquid and oil over the flour and knead with the dough hook of the hand mixer for at least 5 minutes (knead by hand for at least 10 minutes). Finally, knead again with your hands for a few minutes until the dough is smooth. Cover the dough bowl with a cloth and let it rise in a warm place (approx. 35°C) for about 40 minutes.</li>

        <li>Halve the dough and roll it out on a floured work surface into a round shape (Ø approx. 28-30 cm). Preheat the oven to 240 degrees (fan oven: 220). Line two standard trays (38x45 cm) with baking paper. Place the dough on the baking trays and press the edges slightly. Now top the pizza dough with tomato sauce and a variety of ingredients as desired. Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for about 15 minutes.</li>
